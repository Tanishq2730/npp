            "Conrad K. Sangma was born on the 27th of January 1978 in Tura, West Garo Hills, Meghalaya. His father Purno Sangma worked as the Chief Minister of Meghalaya and Speaker of the Lok Sabha and his mother Soradini was a housewife. Conrad has two siblings involved in politics; an elder brother James and a sister Agatha who are both in NPP. His other sister, Christy has taken an altogether non-controversial career path.",
            "He was born in Delhi, and he had his education at St. Columba's School. He has a Bachelor of Science in business administration with a concentration in entrepreneurial management from Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and an MBA in finance from Imperial College London.",
            "In 2009, Conrad got married to Dr. Mehtab Chandee with whom he was blessed with two kids; an elder child Amara who was born in 2011, and the youngest child Katelyn who was born in 2017. Apart from politics, Conrad is into social service in the sense that he is the President of the PA Sangma Foundation, an organization that wants to wipe out illiteracy and pollution. The foundation also runs four colleges in rural Meghalaya, a region that still has a raw taste of architectural mastery. Also, he is the President of the Meghalaya Cricket Association and Sports Academy.",
            "Conrad entered the political arena in the late 1990s assisting his father P. A. Sangma, who was contesting on the NCP ticket. He first vied for a seat in 2004 in the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council and he lost by a small margin. He and his brother James were both elected to the State Assembly in 2008 as members of the NCP. He also served as the Finance, Power, Tourism, General Administration, and IT minister of the state and unveiled his first state budget in his first 10 days in the minister post. In Meghalaya Legislative Assembly he was the Leader of the Opposition from 2009 to 2013. However, he was defeated in the state assembly elections held in 2013 and lost his seat.",
            "The National People's Party was formed in 2016 and Conrad Sangma became the National President of the same after the death of his father in the same year. In May he contested for a by-election for the Tura seat in the Lok Sabha and was victorious with a margin of 1.92 lakh votes.",
            "The NPP has also allied with the national level BJP, which contested in the 2018 Meghalaya legislative assembly election and emerged second party by winning 19 seats in the 60-member house but was defeated by the Indian National Congress. As a result of this, since 30 seats were required to form government, the NPP struck an electoral pact with other regional parties, so that their total number was 34. Conrad Sangma then proceeded to meet the Governor of Meghalaya Ganga Prasad to furnish him with a letter of support from these 34 members with 19 from NPP, six from the United Democratic Party, four from the People's Democratic Front, two from Hill State People's Democratic Party and one Bharatiya Janata Party member besides one independent. He was then announced as the Chief Minister-elect and assumed office on 6 March; he succeeded Mukul Sangma (no relation)."

            "Purno Agitok Sangma, an eminent personality of Indian politics, was born on 1st September 1947 in Chapahati, a tiny village of Garo Hills in Meghalaya. Sangma's early life was coloured in a simple and traditional setup which, given the cultural and geographical flavour of Northeastern India, must indeed have been rooted in a humble background. He started his schooling in Meghalaya and passed out his high school in Shillong. He earned his Bachelor of Arts from St. Anthony's College, Shillong. Continuing her interest in law and politics, she went on to do her Master of Arts in International Relations from Dibrugarh University, Assam. His education was thus the stepping stone of his public service.",
            "Purno A Sangma started his political journey in the early seventies and became a member of the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly in 1973. He began his political career with very noble causes of social justice and the development of the country's Northeastern region. In 1977 he switched to national politics and was duly elected to the Lok Sabha, the Indian lower house of Parliament from Tura. This was the beginning of an extraordinary political career in the lower house that was to last for close to thirty-seven years.",
            "In his political career, Sangma has been elected to several important posts in the government of India. He was the Minister of State for Commerce and Industry, Labour and Coal under Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. The advocacy of labour organisations, industrialisation of the economy, and the welfare of the employees characterised the performance in these capacities. In 1991, he got the portfolio of Minister of Information and Broadcasting through which he was instrumental in opening up the Indian media industry.",
            "In Could 2012, Purno A. Sangma was the founding president of the National People's Party (NPP) party having a regional focus in the northeastern part of the country. The NPP was launched to identify with the oppressed and less privileged people in the region's society. Zopko had finally founded the NPP and through his leadership as the first founder president of the party with emphasis on regionalism or decentralisation, social justice, or the common man's issues.",
            "In his leadership, the NPP was soon established in Meghalaya and other states in the Northeast region as one of the major political parties. The strengths such as Sangma's closeness to the people and his knowledge of the South Asian issues helped the party. The performance improvement of the NPP was a testimony to Sangma's presence, agenda, and concern for the welfare of the people of the Northeast region of India.",
            "He served in the parliament for more than three decades and passed away on March 4, 2016, due to cardiac arrest at the age of 68. He was succeeded with posthumously Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian award in India for his services in the political and social field."

Research has indicated that approximately 36% of the population in the North East is currently living below the poverty line and most of them spend most of their time worrying about how to feed themselves adequately. Most large states in the region do not even meet the basic stock for important food commodities necessary for a healthy life hence the high incidences of malnutrition.",

In this regard, the National People’s Party should take appropriate measures towards promoting local strain agriculture that conserves the environment. The party also wants to introduce new concepts and scientific approaches to increase the yields in agriculture. Although there have been research developments in the agricultural field, additional work is required to ensure producers especially farmers in different fields like agricultural, horticultural, and other related fields get a market for their produce.\nIn most North Eastern states, the agricultural products are naturally organic and sold directly in local markets. There is a need to inspire farmers to innovate and add value to their products, which will help them earn better returns. Additionally, branding and promoting these farm products can tell their unique stories at regional, national, and global levels. The National People’s Party is committed to making agriculture a key driver of development, ensuring economic stability, and securing food for all. The main areas of focus will be agriculture and the environment, animal husbandry and fisheries, food technology and balancing output, and establishing market links to promote economic stability."

      "overviewText": "Energy conservation can be defined as the ability to perform a task with less energy as compared to its usual methods of accomplishing the tasks. There are numerous benefits of utilizing energy efficient technologies including a reduction in greenhouse emissions, decreased dependency on energy importation and ultimately saving of resources both for the consumer and the economy as a whole.",

        "title": "Energy Efficiency",
        "text": "Renewable energy technologies also contribute towards these objectives, nevertheless, energy intensity reduction is usually the easiest and cheapest strategy to reduce the dependence on fossil energy sources. Pretty much every aspect of the economy, buildings, transportation, industry, and energy production to name but a few offer enormous potential for greater efficiency.\nFor instance, mobile upgrades such as replacing energy-leaching gadgets and appliances, increasing the insulation of structures, and replacing traditional bulbs with LED ones are possible solutions. In transportation, the strategy may mean increasing the fuel consumption rate or popularizing electric cars’ use to minimize energy usage. For instance, in industries, using more efficient machinery and processes will make the energy consumption go down significantly while at the same time increasing production.\nIn the long run, therefore, reducing energy intensity not only contributes positively to the environment but also to the economy. This in turn presents the world with an opportunity to cut down on its use of energy from non-renewable sources hence attaining a better way of life. It's a win-win situation, so we conserve the earth’s environment for future generations while at the same time cutting on expenses."

The North East region has remained highly inconsequential economically even after 75 years of independence of India and it has never been able to realize the potential growth it deserves.

This has made many youths feel useless given the fact that they do not have an opportunity to make something out of themselves.\nNPP has also acknowledged this issue as important noting that it is indeed a key concern to empower the youth. It calls for the establishment of more business and income-generating opportunities by associating the youths with the wonderful natural resources of the region. Even though universities and other institutions have established the trend of awarding degrees to many of the intending students, many of those who graduate especially in the area of agriculture, horticulture, and veterinary sciences are still after government employment opportunities. In this case, they fail to recognize the opportunity of private companies in their areas of interest.\nNPP aims at mobilizing educated youths and professionals to harness the many opportunities that are available in the region. The party feels that youth need to be transformed in a way to embrace other kinds of opportunities apart from government employment the ability to be employers and employees and to be able to come up with business ventures among other productive activities that make them employable."
